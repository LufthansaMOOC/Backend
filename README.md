#### Backend

<h1>Repository for the "Backend" Subteam of the Lufthansa MOOC Project</h1>

<p>
This is the repository for project related backend documentation and useful files and documents of any type.
Since most of the work is configuring the mindbreeze appliance, you'll probably find little to no code in here.
